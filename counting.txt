% Find the number of connected components in the image I using
% bwconncomp built-in function (C will be a structure)
% When I found C, the number of total components will be stored in C 
% as "numComponents" 
% My plan to count the half oranges is  as follows:
% 1) Use connected-component Extraction to eliminate the smaller half cuts first.
% The remaining half cuts of my image is only the bigger ones after that
% operation. After that, I will use exacly same method to eliminate the
% bigger half cuts.


    C =  bwconncomp(SegmentedImg);
    
% Get the value of connected components
    numComponents = size(C.PixelIdxList,2);

% Get the number of pixels in each connected component  
    numPixels = cellfun(@numel,C.PixelIdxList);

% Get the biggest and smallest number of pixels of the connected components
%In "oranges.tif", the largest value of bigger half cut oranges are same,
%but in other test pictures,the biggest value of bigger half cut oranges
%are not same, so I take the average of the biggest and smallest value, and
%do my erase calculations based on this average value. This is because I
%know that small half cut oranges are 100% percent smaller than this
%average pixel value.

    biggestPixel = max(numPixels);
    smallestPixel=min(numPixels);
    average=(biggestPixel+smallestPixel)/2;

    %I created two temporary Image. One of them is to remove the smaller
    %half cut oranges, and the other one is to remove the bigger half cut
    %oranges.
    tempDeleteSmallerHalfCut=SegmentedImg;
    tempDeleteBiggerHalfCut=SegmentedImg;

    %this for loop deletes(set the pixel value as 0) the smaller half cut
    %oranges.
    for j=1: numComponents
         if (numPixels(j)<average )
              tempDeleteSmallerHalfCut(C.PixelIdxList{j})=0;
         end
    end
